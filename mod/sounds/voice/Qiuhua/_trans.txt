  Hm? What's wrong? I'm just trying to get the most out of this. I have to go to the bathroom. I'll be back in a minute. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

  Commander, where are you going next? I'm looking forward to meeting new friends!

  I told Sabrina that if I were to cut the salami, I would just use the sausage, but she said no. The sausage is delicious, but why?

Series_Daily_003.wav
  I've done a transport flight at the farm. It always smells like fruit and a lot of grains. If I could use it all for cooking...

Series_Daily_004.wav
  Watch out! This knife is really sharp! Be careful not to cut your hand! But, if I don't have these tools, I can't make delicious food!

Series_Daily_005.wav
  Can you eat this? How can you eat it? Commander, do you like it?

  I'm hungry...

Series_Skill01__VO_Qiuhua_Single_Skill_001.wav
  I'm getting better at this!

Series_Skill02__VO_Qiuhua_Single_Skill_002.wav
  I don't care if you regret it!

Series_Tone_Positive_001.wav

Series_Ultimate__VO_Qiuhua_Single_Ultimate_SSR_001.wav
  Mijin-giri and suage, which do you prefer?

  Happy birthday, Commander! I made a cake with chouju noodles and subuta flavor! Enjoy!

  Happy birthday, Commander! Today I prepared a feast of Elis-style ingredients and my special technique! And if I had Maydyn's sake, it would have been perfect.

Single_Christmas_001.wav
  Commander, can you take the light? I have to finish decorating the tree and go to the kitchen. Sabrina will teach me how to make cinnamon apple pie. Please look forward to the completion.

Single_Christmas_002.wav
  Merry Christmas, Commander! I made a chicken with the recipe of roast chicken taught by Sabrina! How is it? The taste of Christmas-style chicken is... It's pretty good, right?

Single_Friendliness_001.wav
  Move, move! It's a freshly made new menu! Ah, Commander! How is it? Would you like to taste it?

Single_Friendliness_002.wav
  It seems that last night you were working late. I helped you if you called me.

Single_Friendliness_003.wav
  You're late for dinner. I made a small meat spring roll lunch. It's hot!

Single_Friendliness_004.wav
  That's a mouthful, this is two, and this is a full meal. What are you writing? I was writing down the commander's meal.

Single_Friendliness_005.wav
  Mmm, what a nice day! Let's go for a walk together! It's the best thing to do in the morning, looking for a place to eat while being blown away by the wind!

Single_Friendliness_006.wav
  A dish that is not a big deal is the result of the hard work of the cook and the farmer. Please eat while tasting the love that is in the dish.

Single_Friendliness_007.wav
  If you don't have any urgent work, why don't you go to the dark market? There are many people there, so if you like something, you can get it for cheap!

Single_Friendliness_008.wav
  Delicious food needs a story, atmosphere, and environment. How about a Chinese-style dinner? Let's call it our story and make it a special menu for the commander!

Single_Login_001.wav
  Commander, would you like to eat something?

Single_MidAutumn_001.wav
  There is no such thing as a tsukimi without alcohol. Let's drink together? Let's make some tsumamiba and watch tsukiba. Oh, that's great!

Single_MidAutumn_002.wav
  Have you tried the mooncake set I made? Gomoku nuts, Hatsu no mi, Azuki, and meat. Did you like any of them?

Single_NewYear_001.wav
  New year's new menu! Commander, the set meal is ready! New Year's party at night! Look forward to it!

Single_NewYear_002.wav
  Phew, the kitchen cleaning is over. Now I can use the shiny pots. Commander, what kind of food should we celebrate tonight? Leave the rice to me for every meal of the year!

Single_Valentine_001.wav
  Commander, this is not a chocolate bar, I made it for you. It's the best chocolate I've ever eaten!

Single_Valentine_002.wav
  Normal chocolate is boring, so let's twist it a little. How about a chocolate-flavored subuta? No, I can't imitate subuta like that. Then let's make a subuta-flavored chocolate here! What do you think, Commander? Do you like it?
