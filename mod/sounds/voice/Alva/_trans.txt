  No matter what orders you give, the rebel squad will always respond to your expectations.

Series_Daily_002.wav
  The name comes from... Alpha Volk. It's a wolf that leads a flock. She gave it to me.

Series_Daily_003.wav
  The Elmo House is warmer than I thought. There is a place for everyone, including me. If I had belonged to Griffin instead of the Security Bureau, I would have known this feeling sooner.

Series_Daily_004.wav
  I love the name that Ange gave me. I can't call myself that anymore.

Series_Daily_005.wav
  My value lies within myself. I am not something that will be influenced by others.

Series_Hit__VO_Alva_Single_Hit_001.wav
  Here is the plan.

Series_Hitted__VO_Alva_Series_HittedLast.wav
  UGH!

Series_Kill__VO_Alva_Single_Kill_001.wav
  Target silent.

Series_Lose__VO_Alva_Single_Lose_001.wav
  Retreat, all my responsibility. I will never repeat the same mistake.

Series_Skill01__VO_Alva_Single_Skill_001.wav
  Tactical Mode, activate.

Series_Skill02__VO_Alva_Single_Skill_002.wav
  Eliminate the threat!

Series_Tone_Negative_001.wav
  Thank you for watching!

Series_Tone_Negative_002.wav
  I can do it again.

Series_Tone_Negative_003.wav
  In a place like this...

Series_Tone_Positive_001.wav
  All set.

Series_Tone_Positive_002.wav
  Target confirmed.

Series_Tone_Positive_003.wav
  Begin attack.

Series_Tone_Positive_004.wav
  Battle preparation

Series_Tone_Positive_006.wav
  I'll do it.

Series_Tone_Positive_007.wav
  Mission accomplished.

Series_Ultimate__VO_Alva_Single_Ultimate_SSR_001.wav
  Limiter released. Maximum firepower!

Series_Up_001.wav
  Thank you very much.

Series_Up_002.wav
  I will use this power correctly.

Series_Up_003.wav
  Performance improved.

Series_Up_004.wav
  It is necessary as a captain.

Series_Up_005.wav
  The design of Doctor Shaw transcends time.

Series_Win__VO_Alva_Single_Win_001.wav
  The battle is over. All threats have been eliminated. We can proceed now.

Single_Birthday_SSR_001.wav
  Happy birthday. I wanted to prepare something more special, but I think this automatic knife is good. It's okay. I won't open it on my own.

Single_Birthday_SSR_002.wav
  Happy birthday. Time flies so fast. I asked Springfield-san for a present. It's an aroma with a relaxing effect. It's my job to protect your sleep.

Single_Christmas_001.wav
  Santa Claus shouldn't exist, but for some reason there's a present under the pillow. Well, you probably left it behind. I've prepared it too. I'm glad you like it.

Single_Christmas_002.wav
  Good morning, Commander. This year's present is broadcasted more often than last year. Santa Claus also raised his arm. I cleaned your room as a return gift. A present for your pillow? Well, I don't really understand.

Single_Friendliness_001.wav
  Um, I'm sorry. I'm still a little nervous. It's been 10 years, so I have a lot to talk about.

Single_Friendliness_002.wav
  If there is something that changes after time, there is something that does not change like us.

Single_Friendliness_003.wav
  I didn't know you had any connection with the Revenge Squad and Griffin, but... It seems you have something that attracts people and dolls.

Single_Friendliness_004.wav
  I remember the time, 10 years ago in Frankfurt. I only know two people like you.

Single_Friendliness_005.wav
  We left the security office, but sometimes we receive work from the security office, and we are in a pre-cooperative relationship. I finally understood why Riva was always in trouble with the capital.

Single_Friendliness_006.wav
  Why don't you call her by her name? I've learned of her code name and her role as the captain, but... I haven't given her a new name, so I'll leave it to you.

Single_Friendliness_007.wav
  Sometimes, I imagine that all the battles are over. Opening a bookstore, or hunting cats. If you come to the store, I wouldn't be so happy.

Single_Friendliness_008.wav
  Voimastina said that new members are not required, but I and she are also in agreement. If I were to welcome you... Commander, you are the only one I can count on.

Single_Login_001.wav
  Good morning, Commander. I've organized today's schedule.

Single_MidAutumn_001.wav
  Today is a day of chaos. It will be an irreplaceable memory to be able to spend time with you and the Elmo family. I wanted to show this view to her.

Single_MidAutumn_002.wav
  I made a mooncake with everyone in the Springfield cooking class. Mine is azuki beans. I hope it goes well with your mouth. By the way, when I was kneading the mochiko, Voimastina was putting vodka in it, so please be careful.

Single_NewYear_001.wav
  Happy New Year. I wanted to wear red clothes with you, but you refused. Unexpected? That's right. I forgot about the battle and dreamed of enjoying this kind of event.

Single_NewYear_002.wav
  Happy New Year. This year, I decorated the area with Voimastina. The bustling atmosphere of the Hermo building is now a daily routine for me.

Single_Obtain_SSR_001.wav
  The old AN-94 is no longer here. From now on, as Alba, I will fight for you.

Single_Passive_SSR_001.wav
  Analysis complete. This should do it.

Single_SpringFes_001.wav
  According to the horoscope, the spring festival is the day of beginning and hope. Being with you is a new beginning for me. Yes, it's the New Year. ...Eh? The side that I get it from?

Single_SpringFes_002.wav
  Happy New Year. Here, your yearbook. I heard that giving this is a blessing. I hope you can do what you want. Well, now it's your turn to give it.

Single_Title_001.wav
  Dolls Front Line 2, Exilium.

Single_Valentine_001.wav
  I made chocolate with all my gratitude. Please... take it. And this is... medicine. Yes. I also made a Voimastina, just in case.

Single_Valentine_002.wav
  This is my homemade chocolate. I don't think I need any medicine this time. I made it while checking the recipe with Voimastina, so I think it's probably okay.
