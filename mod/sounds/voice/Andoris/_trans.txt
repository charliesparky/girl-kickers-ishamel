Series_Chosen_Auto__VO_Andoris_Series_Up_007.wav
  Huh?

Series_Chosen__VO_Andoris_Series_Up_008.wav
  Yes, Commander.

Series_Daily_001.wav
  Hehe, do your best today too, Commander.

Series_Daily_002.wav
  Here's your freshly brewed coffee. Commander, you can do overtime, but your body is the capital. Don't rely on caffeine alone.

Series_Daily_003.wav
  Ugh... Captain Kuruukai scolded me again for being too spoiled. Eh? You think so too, Commander? I don't think I'm spoiled at all though...

Series_Daily_004.wav
  Dale and Mayrin seem to be good at solving problems that I tend to freeze, but... Even if it's impossible now, if it's those two, they'll find a solution someday. That's what I believe.

Series_Daily_005.wav
  Commander, why don't you join me in training when you're free? If you practice, the data you can give to the technicians will increase, and I think you'll be able to improve your precision assist program.

Series_Daily_006.wav
  The combination of sweets and coffee is excellent, but I'm not good at making sweets. Hmm... I'm good at making Groza, so I'll have to teach you next time.

Series_Daily_007.wav
  What do you do when you're free? That's right. I wonder if I'm getting a gun. I got it. I have to take care of it.

Series_Daily_008.wav
  If something happens, don't hesitate to tell me, Commander.

Series_Daily_009.wav
  When I was in the green area? Hmm... I've been in trouble many times. Well, for me who is in 404 now, it's just a joke.

Series_Daily_010.wav
  Hm? Are you tired? If you're okay, I'll massage your shoulders, how about that? I think it'll be a little easier.

Series_Die__VO_Andoris_Series_Tone_Negative_002.wav
  I need to practice more...

Series_Hit__VO_Andoris_Single_Hit_001.wav
  It'll be over soon.

Series_Hitted__VO_Andoris_Series_HittedLast__VO_Andoris_Series_Shield_Broken.wav
  Ah!

Series_Kill__VO_Andoris_Single_Kill_001.wav
  You defeated it? I'm glad.

  Ah, don't be so depressed. Let's do our best again.

Series_Set_Click__VO_Andoris_Series_Tone_Positive_001.wav
  Rock on!

Series_Set_Fall__VO_Andoris_Series_Tone_Positive_009.wav
  Sorry.

Series_Skill01__VO_Andoris_Single_Skill_001.wav
  How about this?

Series_Skill02__VO_Andoris_Single_Skill_002.wav
  Be careful of your feet.

Series_Tone_Negative_001.wav
  ...

Series_Tone_Positive_002.wav
  I won't let you get away.

Series_Tone_Positive_005.wav
  Now!

Series_Tone_Positive_006.wav
  Don't run away.

Series_Tone_Positive_007.wav
  ...How intense. As I hull out my sword again, aqua behaving this way, suddenly paws against my chest and then poops a layer of seething appear from that cloth on the ground, which was a Port hydrogenラgi… ......

  Roger that.

Series_Ultimate__VO_Andoris_Single_Ultimate_SSR_001.wav
  Is this okay?

Series_Up_001.wav
  Thank you.

Series_Up_002.wav
  Nice!

Series_Up_003.wav
  I see.

Series_Up_006.wav
  I'll remember that.

Series_Win__VO_Andoris_Single_Win_001.wav
  I hope it's as you expected, Commander.

Single_Acquire_R_001.wav
  It's been a year, it's fast. Thank you always, Commander. The warm memories of 404 and Elmo will always remain in my mind.

Single_Acquire_SSR_001.wav
  Huh? It's been another year since I met you, Commander. That's fast. The experience of fighting together and living together this year is irreplaceable for me.

Single_Anniversary_001.wav
  Time flies fast, but you have to cherish the days you spend together. Happy 1st anniversary, Commander!

Single_Birthday_R_001.wav
  Happy birthday, Commander. You don't have to worry about getting old. Overcoming age is a privilege for humans and a weapon.

Single_Birthday_SSR_001.wav
  Today is a day to commemorate, so let's make memories together! Here, this is a present! Happy birthday, Commander!

Single_Birthday_SSR_002.wav
  Happy birthday! I made a birthday cake for you for the first time. It looks weird, but it tastes fine. Yes, Commander? Aaaaah!

Single_Children_001.wav
  When I hear the laughter echoing in the Elmo, I sometimes remember when I was working at school. Children's Day is still a cake with children. How about the commander?

Single_Christmas_001.wav
  Fufufu... Fufufu... Fufufu... Eh? Commander... Ah, this is... I was practicing singing to surprise you... Umm... I wonder if I sang well... Merry Christmas, Commander!

Single_Christmas_002.wav
  Merry Christmas, Commander! Here, this is a present from me. This horn? I found it in the warehouse. It's perfect for Christmas, right?

Single_Duanwu_001.wav
  I heard from Mayrin that mochi rice is a strange ingredient, isn't it? It's chewy and there are various foods in it. You know, I made too much blood rolls. I hope you can help me eat.

Single_Friendliness_001.wav
  Is there anything you want me to do? You don't have to hesitate.

Single_Friendliness_002.wav
  Recently, there's a lot of information that needs to be sorted out, so it takes a long time to categorize it. It's okay. I won't freeze it to this extent.

Single_Friendliness_003.wav
  Huh? Are you... injured? I'll bring an ambulance.

Single_Friendliness_004.wav
  Meirin bought coffee beans. How about later? It smells pretty good.

Single_Friendliness_005.wav
  Phew... I'm glad everyone's safe. I'm used to fighting, but when I think of my friends getting hurt, I'm still nervous. Am I worrying too much?

Single_Friendliness_006.wav
  I've been reading some information about organizing information recently, and I'm a little curious about something. I can talk to you when I'm free, so I wonder if I can talk to you slowly next time.

Single_Friendliness_007.wav
  I heard a lot about the former Commander from the manager of Springfield the other day. So I thought, I wish I could have met the Commander sooner.

Single_Friendliness_008.wav
  giraffe today. I want the Manchester Tteyuu

Single_Friendliness_009.wav
  You like taking pictures? If you put any moment in a picture, no matter how long it takes, you can remember it just by opening the album, right?

Single_Friendliness_010.wav
  I know I'm a bit of a pain in the ass, but I'm still trying my best. If we do more missions together, we can have a deeper connection with you.

Single_Friendliness_011.wav
  It's rare to have such a quiet time, but I'm satisfied just being with you.

Single_Friendliness_012.wav
  The environment in the pollution area is bad, and humans are weak. Be careful not to eat properly without taking care of it.

Single_Friendliness_013.wav
  When I'm by your side, it feels warm. I want to be here forever. Where you are is my other home.

Single_Login_001.wav
  Let's have a fun day today!

Single_MidAutumn_001.wav
  I heard a lot about the Chushu theory from Meirin. There are people who stole the medicine of the immortal and climbed the moon to become goddesses. The moonlight that Meirin said... I wonder if that goddess was eating it on the moon.

Single_MidAutumn_002.wav
  The moon is beautiful today, Commander. I've prepared a mooncake and tea, would you like to join me?

Single_NewYear_001.wav
  Today is an important day, so I thought I'd prepare something. Here, a new coffee. I'm glad you like it. Happy New Year, Commander.

Single_NewYear_002.wav
  It's already New Year, time flies so fast. Happy New Year! I'll be in your care this year too, Commander.

Single_Obon_001.wav
  Obon is a day to remember the dead. There is an old man who used to take care of me, If there is really a soul, My gratitude will surely reach you.

Single_Obtain_SSR_001.wav
  It's an honor to meet you, Commander. Hehe, I've heard a lot of rumors.

Single_Passive_SSR_001.wav
  How about it?

Single_SpringFes_001.wav
  Today's Elmo is always a festive atmosphere, and it's more lively than usual. Umm... This is a muffler. Meirin said that New Year's is a gift. So... Happy New Year, Commander.

Single_SpringFes_002.wav
  I'm currently decorating the Hermo building for the Spring Festival. It's like a family gathering together for the New Year. Commander, happy Spring Festival!

Single_ThanksGiving_001.wav
  Today is the thanksgiving day, huh? When I was in Zucchero, every year at the thanksgiving, I made pumpkin pie with the Springfield store manager. The inside of the store was full of good scent. I'm thinking of making it again this year, but how about the commander?

Single_Title_001.wav
  Dolls Front Line 2 Exilium

Single_Valentine_001.wav
  I left the disk in the command room earlier. Yeah. For now, Valentine's presents. I put everything I want to say to the Commander.

Single_Valentine_002.wav
  Commander, why are you hiding here? I see, everyone loves you, Commander. Then, instead of keeping it a secret, would you like to eat my chocolate first?

Single_WhiteVale_001.wav
  Here you go. This is chocolate. It's said that sugar boosts dopamine secretion and makes you feel better. Commander, you should eat chocolate today. Don't forget the bad things.
