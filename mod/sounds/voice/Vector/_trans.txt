  Roger that.

Series_Cancel__VO_Vector_Series_Tone_Positive_009.wav
  I won't let you escape!

Series_Chosen_Auto__VO_Vector_Series_Tone_Positive_005.wav
  erk

Series_Chosen__VO_Vector_Series_Tone_Positive_003.wav
  Roger that.

Series_Daily_001.wav
  If you have time to ask me about my face color, get to work.

Series_Daily_002.wav
  Dolls are tools after all. You shouldn't put emotions into tools.

Series_Daily_003.wav
  The reason I became the captain of the second squad was because of the few decisions I made in the Kuru world.

Series_Daily_004.wav
  It's a good weapon to use, but don't expect anything else.

Series_Daily_005.wav
  I don't feel any dark aura from the pepli. Could it be a difference in default settings?

Series_Daily_006.wav
  It seems that humans like to talk about the world, but they are so energetic.

Series_Daily_007.wav
  Groza and Kul'kai have different body shapes, but both are helpful.

Series_Daily_008.wav
  I feel a strong obsession with Corfen. What is it that is making her do that?

Series_Daily_009.wav
  I'm not the one that's being followed by Luce. On the contrary. It might sound weird, but this is how I get along with my friends.

Series_Daily_010.wav
  So you're holding his remember man from the cause of your sunshine? Your kindness is a machine, isn't it?

Series_Hit__VO_Vector_Single_Hit_001.wav
  да は は は は は は

Series_Hitted__VO_Vector_Series_HittedLast__VO_Vector_Series_Shield_Broken.wav
  lol

Series_Kill__VO_Vector_Single_Kill_001.wav
  This is the end.

Series_Lose__VO_Vector_Single_Lose_001.wav
  It's as expected.

Series_Set_Click__VO_Vector_Series_Up_004.wav
  I won't know even if I regret it.

Series_Set_Fall__VO_Vector_Series_Up_008.wav
  I will protect you.

Series_Skill01__VO_Vector_Single_Skill_001.wav
  Disappear as you are.

Series_Skill02__VO_Vector_Single_Skill_002.wav
  Even if I'm able to escape?

Series_Tone_Negative_001.wav
  Ah!

Series_Tone_Positive_001.wav
  Then, let's start.

Series_Tone_Positive_002.wav
  Stop!

Series_Tone_Positive_004.wav
  Understood.

Series_Tone_Positive_006.wav
  Die.

Series_Tone_Positive_007.wav
  It's meaningless.

Series_Tone_Positive_008.wav
  Hmph!

Series_Tone_Positive_010.wav
  So that's what it is.

Series_Ultimate__VO_Vector_Single_Ultimate_SSR_001.wav
  Crush them!

Series_Up_001.wav
  Understood.

Series_Up_002.wav
  Is it okay with me?

Series_Up_003.wav
  Waste of resources...

Series_Up_005.wav
  What's the point of this?

Series_Up_006.wav
  Give it your star.

Series_Win__VO_Vector_Single_Win_001.wav
  Operation complete. Let's go home.

Single_Acquire_R_001.wav
  I'm glad I still found somebody...

Single_Acquire_SSR_001.wav
  It's been a year... If only this time could continue forever...

Single_Anniversary_001.wav
  It's been a year... It's the first time I've spent so much time with humans... I look forward to working with you, Commander.

Single_Birthday_R_001.wav
  Happy birthday. What are you surprised about? Well, I don't want to be remembered as someone who didn't give me a present.

Single_Birthday_SSR_001.wav
  Happy birthday, Commander. I left the drawing I drew for you in the command room. Sorry if you don't like it.

Single_Birthday_SSR_002.wav
  If the Commander wasn't born on this day, we wouldn't have met. Sorry, I talked about this on my birthday. Anyway, happy birthday.

Single_Children_001.wav
  I'll give you this. I bought candy for you, but I bought too much. Eh? You don't see it? Well, you don't have to believe it.

Single_Christmas_001.wav
  No matter how fun the time is, it will eventually come to an end. At the very least, I was able to enjoy it. What about you? Merry Christmas, Commander.

Single_Christmas_002.wav
  The stars are like the wind, in the storm... I was practicing, but I might have been bad at it. It's okay, I know it myself. Eh? I want to hear more... You're weird, Commander.

Single_Duanwu_001.wav
  Dragon Boat... It's a strange custom. Even if you win, you can't get anything, right? Humans hate losing so much. Do you feel the same?

Single_Friendliness_001.wav
  Is work done? You've fulfilled your duties, haven't you?

Single_Friendliness_002.wav
  You don't have to force yourself to talk about it.

Single_Friendliness_003.wav
  What's my opinion going to be?

Single_Friendliness_004.wav
  The painting I drew is worthless. If you have a trash can, throw it away.

Single_Friendliness_005.wav
  What I like? If you're asking me to befriend you, you should stop.

Single_Friendliness_006.wav
  I don't know why I came back to you, but I don't know why you left me here again. Why?

Single_Friendliness_007.wav
  I want you to face it with your true heart. That's impossible, isn't it? Well, if you're my opponent, I could try it.

Single_Friendliness_008.wav
  This world is full of contradictions and absurdities. Sometimes I don't know what to do.

Single_Friendliness_009.wav
  Thanks to you and Luchie, I've come to think that this world is not something that I've abandoned yet.

Single_Friendliness_010.wav
  Take a break. If you fall over, it won't look good.

Single_Friendliness_011.wav
  Even if everything you said to me was a lie, please keep lying to me.

Single_Friendliness_012.wav
  Is it hard to understand my painting? If you don't mind, I can explain it to you next time I draw it.

Single_Friendliness_013.wav
  As long as you need me, I will always be by your side.

Single_Login_001.wav
  I'm getting a lot of work. It's up to you to do it or not.

Single_MidAutumn_001.wav
  The moon is beautiful today. What? I didn't say anything weird, did I? I just said that there's a difference in the sketch. And you too.

Single_MidAutumn_002.wav
  Commander, this is Vector. I can't meet you directly during the mission, but I heard that today is the day we all gather together. Um, can you see the moon now? Yes, the moon today is very beautiful.

Single_NewYear_001.wav
  You're taking a break from New Year's, right? I'll do all the work you've got.

Single_NewYear_002.wav
  Another year has passed. Even I'm like this, but you still let me stay without making a face. You've always been spoiled by the Commander. Anyway, I'll be in your care this year too.

Single_Obon_001.wav
  It's almost Obon. It seems like Luchie has prepared a lot, shall we go see it together?

Single_Obtain_SSR_001.wav
  Commander... I never thought we'd meet again. I'm a little happy...

Single_Passive_SSR_001.wav
  It's over, right?

Single_SpringFes_001.wav
  I wrote a story about it, but... I don't know what's written on it. If you don't mind, I'd like you to take it.

Single_SpringFes_002.wav
  I don't have any plans for the spring festival. I'll just lie down and play games once in a while. Will you come with me, Commander? I'll lend you half of my bed.

Single_ThanksGiving_001.wav
  If I were to send my gratitude, would it be to Luchia? Or maybe to you?

Single_Title_001.wav
  Dolls Front Line 2 Exilium

Single_Valentine_001.wav
  It's unrelated to me to show my love for humans, but it's not for you, is it? I left the chocolate in the command room, so if you want to eat it, please.

Single_Valentine_002.wav
  Valentine's Day... I don't think I'll be able to spend such a lovely and lovely day. Are you really going to spend it with me? Then... I'll try to make it at least as atmospheric as possible.

Single_WhiteVale_001.wav
  Even though it's a holiday that has nothing to do with me, why are you giving it back? As a courtesy... Then I can accept it.
