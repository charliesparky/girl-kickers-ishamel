  The beauty department is a little noisy, but when she's there, Kurukai doesn't have time to care about me, so it's easy.

Series_Daily_010.wav
  It's like a manga, the next cut is the end of the mission. It's not a good thing.

  I couldn't achieve my sleep schedule this year. Commander, do you have a paid vacation in Hermo? If not, I'll just sleep for three days and nights...

Single_Acquire_SSR_001.wav
  It's only been a year since I've reunited. It's like I've been working for three years. So... Would you give me a vacation if I worked hard for a year?

Single_Anniversary_001.wav
  Eh? You've been working non-stop for a year? As expected of a commander. I don't have a week. And it's not a good thing that I work anyway.

Single_Birthday_R_001.wav
  Today is the captain's birthday, right? I've prepared the game and the potatoes, so how about a home party from now on?

  Happy birthday, Commander! Here we go... I made my favorite... I made my favorite... It was hard to collect all the ships... Let me know what you think after reading it!

  Happy birthday, Commander. This is a game for two people that I chose to choose. I think you'll definitely like it. If you call me, I'll play with you during the break.

  Speaking of Christmas presents, surprise! Find out where my present is. It's okay. The commander is always at the place where I go.

  I heard that Meirin is making something delicious, so I came to see how it is. Wow, what is this leaf... Eh? Do I have to wrap it in this? I knew it.

Single_Friendliness_001.wav
  You shouldn't expect anything strange from me.

Single_Friendliness_002.wav
  Where is my room? I want to try the effect of the new sleeping bag I bought.

Single_Friendliness_006.wav
  I don't know if you say it all at once, so talk more slowly. Eh? Do you have a mission? Can I skip it?

Single_Friendliness_011.wav
  Ah, Commander... I just came to visit the command room, so don't worry about it. Oh, it looks good to take a nap in this chair. Can I leave some snacks here?

Single_Friendliness_012.wav
  Wow, the command room is really messy. Ah, I think I can lie down here.

Single_Friendliness_013.wav
  Commander, are you pushing my switch? Because when I hear your voice, I'm all sleepy.
