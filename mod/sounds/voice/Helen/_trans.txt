  The Hermogos are like a big family. And the Commander is a pillar of the Empire. Fufu, if you have any problems, I'll be in your care.

  Shall we talk before we go to sleep? It's okay. It's not a scary story, it's a folk tale from various regions and an old story.

  Yes, please leave anything to me. Instead, can I stay with you for a little longer?

  I'm most happy when I can be like this. Wherever you are, wherever you are, is where I return to.

  If everyone is relying on the Commander, who should the Commander rely on? If you like, please rely on me sometimes. If you're tired, please come to my place and rest. I'll tell you an interesting story.

Single_Friendliness_004.wav
  For me, you are different from other humans. That is why I will protect your ideals and defeat those who hinder you.

Single_Friendliness_005.wav
  I had a long dream. Living with you like this was the future I wanted. And it's also my future goal.

Single_Friendliness_006.wav
  I heard that when humans are sad, they want to be held in someone's arms. I don't think you're that sad, Commander, but if that's okay with you... Please come into my arms.

Single_Friendliness_007.wav
  No matter how trivial it is, I will satisfy you. Instead, it's fine if you do it once in a while, but please let me be satisfied too, Commander.
