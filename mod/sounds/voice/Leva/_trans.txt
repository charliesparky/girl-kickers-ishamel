  Hang in there.

Series_Battle_Start__VO_Leva_Series_Tone_Positive_002.wav
  Ready?

Series_Chosen_Auto__VO_Leva_Series_Tone_Positive_007.wav
  What's the order?

Series_Chosen__VO_Leva_Series_Tone_Positive_006.wav
  I'm listening.

Series_Daily_001.wav
  Ahaha, that surprised me. I didn't notice at all. Was it really on purpose? Sorry, sorry. I'll make it more like that next time.

Series_Daily_002.wav
  You can come closer. What? Are you worried about your nose?

Series_Daily_003.wav
  Seeing Kurukai working hard makes me want to bully him no matter what. Ah, you don't have to keep it a secret.

Series_Daily_004.wav
  If you have any questions, I can answer them, but I'm not the type to answer anything other than what I've been asked. So, think carefully about what you're going to ask. Fufufu.

Series_Daily_005.wav
  I wish I had some privacy with my family, but... Of course, if you want to know everything about me, then that's a different story.

Series_Die__VO_Leva_Series_Tone_Negative_001.wav
  In a place like this...

Series_Dying__VO_Leva_Series_Tone_Negative_002.wav
  ......

Series_Hit__VO_Leva_Single_Hit_001.wav
  Want to try it out?

Series_Kill__VO_Leva_Single_Kill_001.wav
  See ya!

Series_Lose__VO_Leva_Single_Lose_001.wav
  It's okay, we just need to make use of it next time. Right?

Series_Set_Click__VO_Leva_Series_Tone_Positive_004.wav
  Do you need me?

Series_Set_Fall__VO_Leva_Series_Tone_Positive_005.wav
  Roger that.

Series_Shield_Broken__VO_Leva_Series_Tone_Negative_003.wav
  It might be a little bad.

Series_Skill01__VO_Leva_Single_Skill_001.wav
  I have to take care of my life.

Series_Skill02__VO_Leva_Single_Skill_002.wav
  Be quiet.

Series_Tone_Positive_001.wav
  Here.

Series_Ultimate__VO_Leva_Single_Ultimate_SSR_001.wav
  If it hurts, tell me.

Series_Up_001.wav
  Hmm, like this?

Series_Up_002.wav
  Hmm, not bad.

Series_Up_003.wav
  Can you still continue?

Series_Up_004.wav
  It feels fresh.

Series_Up_005.wav
  You can rely on me more.

Series_Win__VO_Leva_Single_Win_001.wav
  Was I strong? No, it's all thanks to your command.

Single_Birthday_SSR_001.wav
  Happy birthday! It's once a year, so I wonder if I'll hear you say anything today. You'll know if you say it's a joke or not.

Single_Birthday_SSR_002.wav
  Happy birthday! It's only been 365 days, but you've grown a lot. I'll continue to be of use to you.

Single_Christmas_001.wav
  According to the past mental log... Yeah, Commander was a good girl. Then, you can expect a present tonight. Don't forget to hang your socks.

Single_Christmas_002.wav
  Merry Christmas! It seems that Santa has a present for you, Yoiko. If you're greedy, you can give me two, right?

Single_Friendliness_001.wav
  After all, no matter how much your appearance or position changes, you're still the same as before.

Single_Friendliness_002.wav
  Leave this to me. A nuisance? No way. It's a family favor.

Single_Friendliness_003.wav
  What I like and what I don't like? I don't really like to expose my privacy like that. But if it's you, there's nothing I can't tell you.

Single_Friendliness_004.wav
  You don't have a catch? I do? Eheheh, you always think of me when you say things like that.

Single_Friendliness_005.wav
  What's wrong? You're a terrible bear. If you can't sleep, I can be your talking partner. How about it? You might have a good dream.

Single_Friendliness_006.wav
  The skin of the doll is soft, right? Well, it's not as human as it is. Let me touch the commander's. It's okay, I'll just compare.

Single_Friendliness_007.wav
  Even if you call it family, everyone's relationship is special. What kind of existence do you think I am? Think about it.

Single_Friendliness_008.wav
  If everything is settled, will you promise to share the same time? If you protect me, I won't forgive you.

Single_Login_001.wav
  Hm? What's wrong? Do you want to see my face?

Single_MidAutumn_001.wav
  The moon tonight looks round. Which is rounder, the mochi you drew or the one you drew? What are you talking about? No, I was just kidding, I was serious. Cute.

Single_MidAutumn_002.wav
  The moon is beautiful. Since we're here, let's talk about something romantic. For example... I want to spend the second half of the year with you like this again next year. ...or something like that.

Single_NewYear_001.wav
  Have you decided who you're going to spend the year with? I'll let you choose. UMP45? Reaver? Or me?

Single_NewYear_002.wav
  The bell of the new year has rung. Here's the problem. Who will be the first doll to deliver a happy birthday to the commander? Fufu, you're so dull. You're right in front of me now.

Single_Obtain_SSR_001.wav
  From now on, we will cooperate more closely. Looking forward to it, Commander.

Single_Passive_SSR_001.wav
  Surprise!

Single_SpringFes_001.wav
  New Year's, huh. I hope something changes. For example, our relationship. Fufu, I'm kidding. I don't have a deeper relationship than my family. Or maybe you don't think so?

Single_SpringFes_002.wav
  Do you have any goals for this year? For example, do you want to get even closer with me? Fufu, I'm just kidding. Well, even if it's true, I don't mind.

Single_Title_001.wav
  Dolls Front Line 2 Exilium

Single_Valentine_001.wav
  Here's your Valentine's chocolate. I've prepared some for you, but the Commander's is a little different. If you're interested, shall we open it?

Single_Valentine_002.wav
  This year's chocolate has a special feeling in it. What that is... I'll enjoy it after I finish eating it all.
