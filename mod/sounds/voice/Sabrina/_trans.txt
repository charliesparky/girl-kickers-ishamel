  Springfield is a very good person. Every time I go to Zucchero, he gives me delicious sweets. He doesn't do wireless meals. He's remodeling the cafe equipment as a thank you.

  The other day, I made a cat-eared metal detector and found it in Caloric. But I've never seen Caloric's expression like that, so I gave it to him at the end.

  The weight limit of the Elmo is probably fine, right? I'm sorry, I'll get off right away.

Single_Acquire_SSR_001.wav
  Commander? Why are you here? Ah, don't look! Don't look! Well, whatever. I was making a video of the food I made for you this year. I was actually going to surprise you.

Single_Anniversary_001.wav
  Thanks to the feedback from the commander during my stay in Ermo, I've improved my cooking skills a lot! Hehe, I guess I've taken another step closer to becoming a good cook.

  I'm sorry. The restaurant's reservation was cancelled, so I failed to serve the food I was supposed to give to the commander... But now I'm trying a new dish that no one has ever made, so come and taste it in a while!

Single_Christmas_002.wav
  Alright, then I'll be quiet for the next one... Huh, Commander? You know, Christmas was the theme of the Hexen House. The candy isn't completely stuck yet, so be careful. When night comes, let's eat together!

Single_Duanwu_001.wav
  I was thinking of making a food video for the East, but there are opinions that sweet food is better for blood sausage and that salty food is better for blood sausage. Commander, what should I do?

Single_Friendliness_001.wav
  Commander, come visit Caldo if you have time. I'll be making lots of delicious food and waiting for you.

Single_Friendliness_002.wav
  Commander, are you on social media? Do you follow each other?

Single_Friendliness_010.wav
  No matter how much you eat, you won't get fat, Commander's mean! Uuu... Am I really fat?

Single_Friendliness_011.wav
  Thank you for noticing. I'm not going to change my body yet. It's true that we're old, but we've been together for a long time. How should I say it... I'm lonely and I can't do it.

Single_Friendliness_012.wav
  Commander, can you tell me how to cook? Unlike humans, dolls can only be made according to the program, but humans can make something new with their rich imagination, right?

  When I cook for the Commander and when I cook for the customers, the feeling is different, right?

Single_NewYear_001.wav
  Are you all cleaning up after the end of the year? Then try using the all-automatic vacuum cleaner I made! If you put it there after it starts, it will automatically clean the outside and inside of the Elmogou. If this is the case, no one will have to do it.

Single_NewYear_002.wav
  Commander, happy new year! Thank you for accompanying me to break the plates yesterday! I heard that luck comes when you break the plates that you don't need anymore on New Year's Day. It seems that it will be a great year to see the results of yesterday!

  Humans go back to their own homeland to find their own home. I wonder if there are people who should go to the doll's home...
