Series_Daily_001.wav
  Hello, Commander! Do you need any help? I'm really bored right now, so...

Series_Daily_002.wav
  Good morning, Commander! Huh? You don't look well. How about a refreshing nutritional drink? It's okay! It's completely harmless!

Series_Daily_003.wav
  Ah, it's already this late? Commander? Are you still working? You need to be careful with your life too. You need to listen to your doctor's advice!

Series_Daily_004.wav
  I see... Hm? I was researching Nemesis-chan's fortune-telling! Alright, here's one. Let's see when the Commander will draw the lottery!

Series_Daily_005.wav
  Captain Groza, you're so cool. And you're so kind. You're like... ...a big sister.

Series_Daily_006.wav
  I think it's better to be a little faster here. Yeah, yeah, that's it! Oh, Commander! Hehe, it's a new special move for Pepli-chan! Huh? Commander, are you listening?

Series_Daily_007.wav
  Yaaaaahoo! Did I surprise you, Commander? Hehe, I'm sorry. It's nothing. I was so bored, I wanted to disturb the serious working Commander!

Series_Daily_008.wav
  And Valerie Remesis. Okay,okay, The best of

Series_Daily_009.wav
  You can touch people's heads and pay for what you pay! Even if you're a commander, you can't do that!

Series_Daily_010.wav
  Ah, sorry! It's nothing. I thought everyone was getting along. Hmm, if Colfen were Meirin-chan, the Commander would be long gone by now. Fufufu...

  I don't think I can pass!

Series_Up_001.wav
  Ah, thank you very much!

Series_Up_002.wav
  Well then.

Series_Up_003.wav
  Eh? Are you sure?

Series_Up_004.wav
  trainer

Series_Up_005.wav
  I need to become stronger...

Series_Up_006.wav
  That's a good one!

Series_Up_007.wav
  Commander, you're really...

Series_Up_008.wav
  Roger that!

Single_Acquire_R_001.wav
  Oh! It's been a year since I met the Commander! Thank you for taking care of me for a year! I will continue to provide the best medical services!

Single_Acquire_SR_001.wav
  Commander, do you remember what day it is today? Hmm? I forgot your expression. Today is the anniversary of the first anniversary of the meeting of Commander and Corfen! So I prepared a special gift for you! Please open it quickly!

Single_Acquire_SSR_001.wav
  Hmm... For a year... I really... Ah! I'm surprised, Commander! Eh? This? No, it's the strategy report from last week. It's not a celebration. Commander, Thank you for spending the last few days with me! I'm so happy to be with you, Corfen!

Single_Anniversary_001.wav
  Tada! Are you surprised? Hehe, I will give you a lot of beautiful pebbles as a reward for your great achievements in the pollution area! I'm really looking forward to what will happen to me in the future when I spend time with you, Commander!

Single_Birthday_R_001.wav
  Commander! This is a birthday cake made by Corfen! Happy birthday!

Single_Birthday_SR_001.wav
  Commander, happy birthday! You and I will celebrate every year from now on, right? That's right!

Single_Birthday_SSR_001.wav
  Commander! Happy birthday! Happy birthday! Now, where's the present? Hehe, you won't find it this time! Wait, what's that? You already found it? But don't worry, it's definitely a no-no! Come on, open it up!

Single_Birthday_SSR_002.wav
  Today is the commander's birthday, so happy birthday! Is there anything you want me to do? If you're a good medical doll, you might be able to help me!

Single_Children_001.wav
  Commander, today we have a present, right? Huh? That face... Don't tell me you don't know what day it is today? It's Children's Day! The captain said that children get presents on that day! It's also on the Corfen, right?

Single_Christmas_001.wav
  Look, Commander! I made the Christmas tree shine! I decorated it with lots of super pretty star lights! It's all made by Corfen! And what's more, there's a Christmas present for you, Commander! It's next to the biggest star, so please take it with you!

Single_Christmas_002.wav
  Commander, why don't we make the Hermo Go a Christmas-type? How about decorating it with a beautiful stone and star-shaped lights? And then... I'm planning to hide the present somewhere, so please do your best to find it, Commander!

Single_Duanwu_001.wav
  Hermogon! Go! Like a brave dragon, advance forward! I will carve a great miracle on the earth! Oh, Commander! I asked Meirin-chan. In the vocabulary theory, they compete with each other in dragon. Hermogon also feels like a dragon in the desert, right?

Single_Friendliness_001.wav
  Hmm? Commander, what's wrong? If it's about medical care, please consult with anything Corfen!

Single_Friendliness_002.wav
  It's okay! No matter how bad the wound is, this Corfen will fix it all! Ah, of course, it's a matter of survival!

Single_Friendliness_003.wav
  I'm running out of medical supplies. Hmm... The commander has been injured lately. Commander, please take a break. If anything happens to your body, it will be difficult.

Single_Friendliness_004.wav
  Ah, ah, you're so worn out again. If the commander doesn't have a spare body, he can't get a mental backup. Do you understand? Oh, what's this expression? The picture of the commander enduring pain. Not bad.

Single_Friendliness_005.wav
  Commander! Commander! Oh, you're here! Oh, are you a little girl? No, I'm not! I'll give you a medicine that will make you feel good! Huh? A side effect? No way!

Single_Friendliness_006.wav
  Um, Commander! I... I... Ah, nothing! Um... Do you really want to know? Commander...

Single_Friendliness_007.wav
  This feeling is... ...something strange... Ah! Commander! Did you... ...do something? Depending on the situation, you will be responsible for it!

Single_Friendliness_008.wav
  Huh? Commander, you haven't been doing anything weird lately, have you? Ah, no, not that! What the hell am I asking? But, Commander, you've changed a bit. How should I put it... No, it's probably my imagination!

Single_Friendliness_009.wav
  S-S-S-Captain! You never abandon your friends, right? Eh? I-I just asked you! And the answer is yes, right? I won't let you say no!

Single_Friendliness_010.wav
  Commander...! Commander!? I can feel I'm dreaming... What about dolls... Or if I'm not imagining, really...?

Single_Friendliness_011.wav
  Ta-da! Commander, I made cranberry chocolate! So, what's with that expression? It shouldn't taste bad, judging by its appearance. Anyway, Commander, please try it!

Single_Friendliness_012.wav
  refrain! Is it OK with me to stay here? I can stay as it is. Just like it is now . After all, today is the day I arrived at the headquarters Theև so then where

Single_Friendliness_013.wav
  Um... Commander! I just made an important decision! Eh? Decision about what? I'll figure it out someday! As long as you're here...

Single_Login_001.wav
  Hmm, what should we do today?

Single_MidAutumn_001.wav
  Commander, will the moon come out tonight? Meirin said that today is the day to observe the full moon together. And... You're going to eat a round chocolate-like mooncake? Sounds fun! Let's make a colfen for the commander next time!

Single_MidAutumn_002.wav
  Commander, you can't eat too much and drink too much because it's a neutral theory. It's hard if Helena-chan imitates you. Huh? You want to eat the mooncake I made? I can't help it. I'll forgive you if it's just one.

Single_NewYear_001.wav
  Before the third world war, it was snowing here when it was the new year. But the snow is dull now. I saw a lot of old photos. The snow at that time was very beautiful. I want to see that kind of snow with the commander. Happy New Year, Commander!

Single_NewYear_002.wav
  It's been a year already. When I'm with you, I can feel the flow of time really fast. Anyway, Happy New Year! I've prepared some snacks with Vepri-chan, so please come and see them!

Single_Obon_001.wav
  ... Commander, today is your birthday. Humans think of the person who passed away on this day and strive for it. Does Commander have a way to strive for it? A long time ago, I met a very nice lady and learned a lot of things. At that time, I wish I could have met her.

Single_Obtain_R_001.wav
  I heard that the Commander knows a lot of ways to become stronger, so I hurriedly came here.

Single_Obtain_SR_001.wav
  Ah, did something really troublesome happen? Let's have Corfen help you.

Single_Obtain_SSR_001.wav
  Oh, it's the Commander. Don't worry. My heart is completely at the Commander's side.

Single_Passive_SSR_001.wav
  I'll take additional shots!

Single_SpringFes_001.wav
  Wow! Commander! Happy New Year! I learned something good from Meilin-chan! Commander, please sit down and have a good time today! When I make that Baku-chiku, let's play together! It's so much fun!

Single_SpringFes_002.wav
  Tama-ya! Can you see that fireworks smiling? Actually, I made that fireworks with Meirin-chan so that Commander can smile too! If Commander has a sad face, Korfen will also be sad.

Single_ThanksGiving_001.wav
  Commander, Commander! I want to spend the day with you! Huh? Spend the day with me every day? No, that's not at all! I'm just fighting all the time! Today is Thanksgiving Day! It's meaningless if you don't spend the day with your family and your loved ones!

Single_Title_001.wav
  Dooooooooooooooooooooll's Front Line 2 Exilium!

Single_Ultimate_SSR_001.wav
  It doesn't hurt, it doesn't hurt!

Single_Valentine_001.wav
  Hmm, I wonder if the greeting card is better? Yeah, you don't know who it is unless you prove it. Huh? S-S-S-Ske-kun! Ah, it's nothing! Ah, happy Valentine's Day! Tonight's dinner and grea... no, dinner! Look forward to dinner!

Single_Valentine_002.wav
  Here, this is Valentine's chocolate made by Corfen! Oh? You already noticed? Hehe, I'm giving it to the Commander, so of course I want to make it special!

Single_WhiteVale_001.wav
  Yes, yes! Commander, you like shiny things, right? In other words, you like shiny necklaces, right? I spent a lot of time polishing it, but after all... Hmm... I can't say it's beautiful, but please accept it! It's a return gift for Valentine's Day, Commander!
