  Are you scared?

Series_Chosen_Auto__VO_Clukay_Series_Up_007.wav
  Not at all

Series_Chosen__VO_Clukay_Series_Up_003.wav
  It's because of training.

Series_Daily_001.wav
  What are you doing? I think you can tell by looking at me. I have a lot to do as the captain of the security department, such as organizing documents, pre-investigation of requests, and preparation. I don't have a reliable assistant like Groza or Mary.

Series_Daily_002.wav
  After Andris came, MuCity's habit of skipping the group became terrible. Commander, is there any good way to educate him?

Series_Daily_003.wav
  I've been observing you all this time, and I've come to understand that my team management philosophy is different from that of Groza or Riva. Well, I can't say that 404 is the best.

Series_Daily_004.wav
  Are all the current bike designers part-time jobs or something? All the cars that have been announced this year are good in terms of specs, and the design is not a piece of the essence. I say that there is supply because there is demand, but I can only sigh that there are people who buy such things.

Series_Daily_005.wav
  Low- specialty pillows? You're gonna lightatto a coffee syphon pillow, and aود relatable Prawn Isotopy Dock News!? Ugh... They didn't like what I was doing, so Ipaired them for next year's

Series_Daily_006.wav
  I realized after I threw away the useless hesitation I had held back in the past. I'm the only one who can pull 404. The future of 404 will be the proof that I can be perfect.

Series_Daily_007.wav
  The weak are not needed in 404. Even if they don't want it, I'll make them the strongest combat dolls.

Series_Daily_008.wav
  Seriously, how can I raise those Bonkura to become elite dolls?

Series_Daily_009.wav
  It was a surprising harvest, but as I was using it on missions, I gradually started to like large bikes.

Series_Daily_010.wav
  I finally lost to the beauty department. If you keep following me around and nagging, it's not going to happen. There's no one as naive as you at the orbit base, right?

Series_Hit__VO_Clukay_Single_Hit_001.wav
  I love you.

Series_Hitted__VO_Clukay_Series_HittedLast.wav
  Thank you for watching!

Series_Kill__VO_Clukay_Single_Kill_001.wav
  Target silent.

Series_Lose__VO_Clukay_Single_Lose_001.wav
  Retreat for now... My judgement was wrong.

Series_Set_Fall__VO_Clukay_Series_Tone_Positive_005.wav
  Attention!

Series_Shield_Broken__VO_Clukay_Series_Tone_Negative_002.wav
  Damn it!

Series_Skill01__VO_Clukay_Single_Skill_001.wav
  Learn the reality!

Series_Skill02__VO_Clukay_Single_Skill_002.wav
  I raise my hand.

Series_Tone_Positive_003.wav
  Continue.

Series_Tone_Positive_009.wav
  brain- أو

Series_Tone_Positive_010.wav
  Give up.

Series_Ultimate__VO_Clukay_Single_Ultimate_SSR_001.wav
  If you're going to surrender, then do it now.

Series_Up_002.wav
  Kind of.

Series_Up_004.wav
  It's not enough yet.

Series_Up_005.wav
  I need to add more training.

Series_Up_006.wav
  Not yet.

Series_Win__VO_Clukay_Single_Win_001.wav
  Heh, I'm lucky to have turned 404 into an enemy.

Single_Acquire_R_001.wav
  It's true that it's been a year since we met, but I don't think it's something to celebrate. Let's celebrate even when it's our fifth year. This is a mission, so failure is not allowed.

Single_Acquire_SR_001.wav
  It's been a year since we've been in a partnership. It's about time we got through the meeting, right? We'll be more strict from now on. Commander, please do your best to stay with me.

Single_Acquire_SSR_001.wav
  It's been a year since then. When I'm with you, I feel like time goes by so fast. I guess that's why you're the same no matter how many years pass.

Single_Anniversary_001.wav
  In this year, we have established a good relationship. The fact that I'm the 404, even if the position of the commander changes, it will not be a

Single_Birthday_R_001.wav
  Happy birthday. What's with that smile? I'll tell you, but please don't relax because it's your birthday.

Single_Birthday_SR_001.wav
  Happy birthday. I hope we can maintain a good relationship this year. ...Aren't you a bit too much? There are many organizations that want to establish a cooperative relationship with 404. The Commander is a blessed one.

Single_Birthday_SSR_001.wav
  Commander, I left something in the break room. What? It's a birthday present. Did you think it was a request? Wait, no! Not now! I'll see it when I'm away.

Single_Birthday_SSR_002.wav
  Today was a special day, right? Here, this. Eh? You don't have a clue? Commander, today is your birthday. Is there anything else special?

Single_Children_001.wav
  The balloon Misty and Bioka were holding... Did you give it to them? Haa... You're not a child, so you're not going to be able to... Eh? I have a share... Th-That kind of child-fooling toy... W-Well, it might be just right for decorating the room...

Single_Christmas_001.wav
  Commander, would you like me to decorate this candy cane on the tree? A little more to the left... Yes, yes, that's fine. And... this... Ah, that's something you don't need to decorate! I prepared it in excess... It's a top star. Merry Christmas...

Single_Christmas_002.wav
  Merry Christmas, Commander. Is this it? This is... The gingerbread man, and Andrés and the beautician were trying it out, so... I-I also tried making it. Yes. I made it like you. Shall we eat it?

Single_Duanwu_001.wav
  ... Tie this tight... Alright, now we have a square triangle. Hm? Can I have a more free shape of the bloodstain? As an elite doll, I don't intend to accept such a small task. The bloodstain in your hand is also mine. Here, I'll fix it, so please give it to me quickly.

Single_Friendliness_001.wav
  I still have work to do, so please feel free to go ahead.

Single_Friendliness_002.wav
  I'm currently drawing the design of the custom bike, but is the commander familiar with the bike?

Single_Friendliness_003.wav
  Commander, if possible, would you like to introduce your familiar dark broker? The 404's purchasing route has been unstable recently, and I will definitely return this loan.

Single_Friendliness_004.wav
  I've been seeing old friends lately, and they all said I've changed. Do you think so, Commander?

Single_Friendliness_005.wav
  Commander, you were looking at our mock training earlier. How is the 404's ability?

Single_Friendliness_006.wav
  Groza, Nemesis... They're all excellent dolls. Yes, as you can imagine, we're calculating the amount of money for the Elmo. Of course, it's not a waste of time to hire a commander who's lost his way.

Single_Friendliness_007.wav
  Commander, would you like to go for a drive? I got something good from the previous mission and I put it on my bike, so I want to try it right away.

Single_Friendliness_008.wav
  HKM4, 416, and KURUKAI. The only thing that has changed is not just the name. I once made a distinction in the past, but now it doesn't matter anymore. You understand this feeling, right? Commander.

Single_Friendliness_009.wav
  Commander, you came to the right place. For the next request, you need to wear a suit, so if possible, you can decide on your own. It's just a job, so don't imagine anything strange.

Single_Friendliness_010.wav
  What is this? Reward? Commander, 404 and I are not that cheap. ... You still don't understand? This time I just wanted to help. I don't need that kind of money.

Single_Friendliness_011.wav
  Welcome back. Um, why are you looking at me like an idiot? Huh? Were you laughing? Me? You-you must be mistaken. You've gotten a little blind, Commander.

Single_Friendliness_012.wav
  Now, would you mind not talking about your request? Please let me rest for a bit. I feel somewhat at ease in front of you, Commander. Well, it's not too bad.

Single_Friendliness_013.wav
  You're looking at another doll again... Is that really all you want? Well, we'll see who's the best for you.

Single_Login_001.wav
  You're late. I've been waiting.

Single_MidAutumn_001.wav
  Andris said today is the day of the war, so Bioka is having a party at 404. Haa, they're going to be a pain in the ass again. How about you, Commander?

Single_MidAutumn_002.wav
  Commander, you saw the message I sent, right? Because they ordered a huge mooncake, we had no choice but to eat it together. Everyone is waiting for you. Me? Of course I was waiting for you too. I'm already used to waiting for you, Commander.

Single_NewYear_001.wav
  Commander, when did you get there? I'm working on a plan for next year. It's a secret of 404, so I'll try to erase it... Eh? You saw my name? That's... Commander, you're an important collaborator of 404, so it's natural that your name is on it, right?

Single_NewYear_002.wav
  Thank you for your help last year, Commander. Let's cooperate more closely this year. Of course, there is no exemption.

Single_Obon_001.wav
  Obon... There's no one to hurt, and it's a holiday that I don't really feel. And, rather than drowning in the past, it's better to protect what you have now, so you won't regret it later, right?

Single_Obtain_SSR_001.wav
  I'm the head of the 404th Gen, the elite doll Kuru. It's been a while, Commander.

Single_Passive_SSR_001.wav
  Beware of surroundings

Single_SpringFes_001.wav
  Commander, I'm writing a Tsuiren right now, but according to Meirin, it's best to use the same number of letters and vowels in the paper and the letter and use the same number of letters and vowels to make it a blessing. If you divide the code names of the 404 members, they're exactly the same number of letters, so you can put in the year of the gold... What are you laughing at? Nothing's wrong, right?

Single_SpringFes_002.wav
  Happy New Year, Commander. What was I doing? I was just making the paper cutout for the window, but... The time it takes is because I'm pursuing perfection. W-Wait, those failure plans are something I plan to throw away later! Please don't look!

Single_ThanksGiving_001.wav
  What a troublesome holiday. There are so many thanks from companies that have been working since morning. The text looks like a one-off message, and I don't feel any sincerity at all. Eh? You want to thank me? You mean the Commander? We're not that hard to deal with...

Single_Title_001.wav

Single_Valentine_001.wav
  Here's your chocolate... Of course it's handmade. You know that, right? It's so well wrapped... it looks like it's on the market... Huh... I guess that's how much you know, Commander.

Single_Valentine_002.wav
  Yes, Commander. This is my chocolate. Yes, the taste and shape are perfect. The volume has also increased considerably, so I will probably not eat any other chocolates today. Then, please ride my bike next time. I will take you to a good place.

Single_WhiteVale_001.wav
  How is Valentine's Day and White Day different? No, I don't want any rewards. Yes, it's to learn human manners. I'm prepared for it, right?
