  The most important thing in blending is to find the right combination of beans. If the beans are too different, it will have a unique flavor, and even if you combine similar beans, the taste will not change. Looking at it this way, we are the best blend.

  The stronger the rain and wind, the more grateful the silence in the room is. When you're tired, don't hesitate to stop by the Zucchero.

Single_MidAutumn_002.wav
  But I wish that people would not be long in the sun. We must not be apart from each other and fight together. After experiencing the true separation, I began to understand the feelings of the poet who wrote this poem. However, this feeling has never been in the Kanji.

  Meilin-san told me that if I give you a year-end gift with a red envelope, good luck will come, so I prepared some for you. Would you like to give it to me instead? A year-end gift is something an adult gives to a child? Fufu, that's why.
