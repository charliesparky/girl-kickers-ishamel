  364...365! Another year has passed! Phew... I feel like time really flies after meeting the Commander! I look forward to your continued support of Sharkly! It's a promise!

Single_Acquire_SR_001.wav
  In the past, I thought that the flow of time was just increasing the number of days of operation, and that there was no special meaning. But this year I met the Commander, every day was warm. Let's continue to make memories together, Commander!

Single_Birthday_SR_001.wav
  Ta-da! Happy birthday, Commander! For a super idol, remembering the birthday of a sincere fan is a basic of a basic! Hehe, what do you want as a present? A sign? A shake? Or a hug?

Single_Birthday_SSR_002.wav
  Huh? The command room is dark? That's because Sharkly-chan turned it off! Sharkly, I made a cake for the commander! Here I go! 3, 2, 1, light up! Happy birthday!

  Shan shan shan, shan shan shan. Tonakai-san has brought a super idol! I've prepared a present for you, Commander. Guess where it is. Is it under your socks? Or under the tree?

Single_Duanwu_001.wav
  This green food is kind of weird. It's triangular and sharp. The Springfield manager said that I should temporarily put this in the menu. But even so, why do I have to do a boat show on stage?

Single_Friendliness_001.wav
  Super Idol Sharkly! I'll do my best to protect everyone's smiles!

Single_Friendliness_002.wav
  Commander, you know about the Zucchero, right? Sharkly is doing a show there, but... If you don't mind, I'd like you to come see it sometime.

Single_Friendliness_003.wav
  Commander, you don't look well. If you have any hope, Sharkly will show you the best show anytime!

Single_Friendliness_004.wav
  Commander, when you move your body, you will be given a lot of dopamine that makes you feel happy! So, why don't you dance with Sharkly from now on?

Single_Friendliness_005.wav
  I've been to quite a few places, but there's no one who's more eye-catching than the cafe's customers. Hehe, I wonder how the commander's eyes are.

Single_Friendliness_006.wav
  Commander, you can't wrinkle your forehead! You look tired. If you're going to sleep, should I sing a lullaby for you?

Single_Friendliness_007.wav
  Commander, looks are very important. So I'll make it for you. I won't play pranks. Don't worry.

Single_Friendliness_008.wav
  How was it, the show earlier? It was really good, right? B-Bepri, compared to the show, how was it?

Single_Friendliness_009.wav
  Recently, I've been looking for the commander in the audience seat. Please sit in the front row when you sit down. Then you can find it in one eye.

Single_Friendliness_010.wav
  Commander, do you have time after the show ends tonight? An hour? No, 30 minutes is fine. I have something I want to take you to. Just the two of us, secretly. Right?

Single_Friendliness_011.wav
  Commander, why are you staring at me like that? What's on my face? Hehe, well, I can't help it. It's okay, look. After all, I'm a perfect idol no matter where I look from 360 degrees.

Single_Friendliness_012.wav
  This necklace is pretty, right? It's the latest model of the year! Will you wear it, Commander? Ah, wait, wait, wait! Don't wrap your hair around me!

Single_Friendliness_013.wav
  Hmm... Recently, there's been no excitement among the audience. Throwing kisses and winking are now in the late days. I have to think of some new action. Hehe. Commander, will you be my practice partner?

Single_Login_001.wav
  Commander, that was perfect! Hey, which outfit should I wear for today's show?

Single_MidAutumn_001.wav
  Idols are like the moon, shining in the darkness, accepting everyone's wishes and thoughts. Someone said that, but I don't think so. I want to become the moon's idol and have everyone come to the moon!

Single_MidAutumn_002.wav
  Hmm... Commander... I got a goldfish sake from Meirin, but... My head is spinning... Is this what Meirin said about being spoiled by the moon? Ah... Hey, Commander... Which one of us smells better, me or this sake?

Single_NewYear_001.wav
  Commander, Happy New Year! Commander, do you have anything you want to ask me? For Sharkly, I want to be with you every year from now on. Hehe Are you getting dizzy? What? If I say it, it's meaningless? Ah, wait, wait, not now!

Single_NewYear_002.wav
  Stop it, Commander! Look at that camera over there! Here! Cheese! Fufufu! I'll sign your first two-shot for the new year! Please keep pushing for Sharkly this year!

Single_Obon_001.wav
  Do you know Ghost Diva? It's about an idol who sings unbearably like a pepuri. Uhehe, just kidding! The concept of the cafe tonight is ghostly. I'm waiting for the commander to come.

Single_Obtain_SR_001.wav
  Ehehe, I'm ready! Who is the lucky one to be pulled out by Sharkling?

Single_SpringFes_001.wav
  Phew, we made it! It's getting more exciting! This is the first time I've ever celebrated a day like this! I should have refused to invite you to the live show! Ah, the fireworks are starting to fly! Happy Spring Festival, Commander! Does this look right? Ehehe

Single_SpringFes_002.wav
  Eh? A party in the spring? The Commander and Sharkly will be joining? What would be good? A duet? Dance? Or... Magic? Whatever it is, Sharkly will do her best!

Single_ThanksGiving_001.wav

Single_Valentine_002.wav
  Commander? Ah... The person who ate the chocolate from Sharkly will be with you! Now, let's go on a date!
