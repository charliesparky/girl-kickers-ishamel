I think I wasn't absolutely sure at that time, but it's obvious how під monthly gives you food progressive tea. ...The actual duty of government shots is a bit insane-. But what would be most flexible since I wasn't looking at you myself...

  Hmm... Oh, Commander! Don't steal it! Beppuri will be patient until she finishes practicing! It's a new song I've been waiting for!

Single_Friendliness_007.wav
  If I go on a mission, I won't be able to meet the commander again... Okay, let's finish this quickly and go home!

Single_Friendliness_008.wav
  Hehe, no, not really. I just want to be with you, Commander. Eh? Commander, what did you just say?

Single_Friendliness_009.wav
  Commander, Commander, would you like to come to the break room later? Beppu-ri, I want to sing the new song you just heard to the Commander!

Single_MidAutumn_002.wav
  I learned from Meirin that the Chushu Festival is a day when the family is in a mess, but since the Vepri are always in a mess, is every day the Chushu Festival? Hmm, I don't know, but I know that the blood is delicious!

Single_Valentine_002.wav
  Commander! Ta-da! Happy Valentine's! I never thought I'd get chocolate from an idol on a curtain call! Eh? It's melting? I'm sorry! It seems like it melted at the body temperature while I was dancing...

Single_WhiteVale_001.wav
  I-I can't believe that you hate me! Because I'm an idol! Idols are loved, right? But, why are you still... Ah, Commander! You came to give me a present?
