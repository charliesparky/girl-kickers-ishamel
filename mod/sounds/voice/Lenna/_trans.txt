  Alright! I did my best for a year! I can rest for today!

Series_Battle_Start__VO_Lenna_Series_Set_Click__VO_Lenna_Single_Login_001.wav
  Fufu, I'll finish it today too!

Series_Chosen__VO_Lenna_Series_Up_003.wav
  Okay?

Series_Daily_001.wav
  Foo, foo, foo. Good morning, Commander. Me? I'm going to contact Revanee from now on.

Series_Daily_002.wav
  Eh? There's still work to do? No way... Alright, let's finish this quickly!

Series_Daily_003.wav
  Oh, it's a sunny day today. I guess I should get going.

Series_Daily_004.wav
  That was...Libanee? Eh? To the Commander? Ehh, what does Libanee mean? That's fine, tell me! Because I haven't gotten a call from Libanee for a long time! Even two days is long enough!

Series_Daily_005.wav
  Ehehe, how do I look? I look cool, right? I designed it for Karin-nee's mission. But I prefer the previous outfit. Because it matches with Riva-nee.

Series_Daily_006.wav
  Ah, I want to hear Riva-nee's voice! Hm? Ah, it's 4-5-nee's new codename. I gave it to her.

Series_Daily_007.wav
  Ah, I'm tired. It's not all good to be able to work. No.

Series_Daily_008.wav
  Hey, Commander! Long time no see! You've been showing up sometimes, haven't you? Karin-nee is worried about you... Oh, no! She left! Anyway, welcome back, Commander!

Series_Daily_009.wav
  Haa, the size is different, but the hairstyle is also different ... Hmm, the commonality with Libanet is disappearing ...

Series_Daily_010.wav
  Yeah! Mental improvement, firepower improvement, ability improvement! I'm glad I participated in the experiment!

Series_Die.wav
  I-I lost!?

Series_Hit__VO_Lenna_Single_Hit_001.wav
  This way!

Series_Hitted__VO_Lenna_Series_HittedLast__VO_Lenna_Series_Shield_Broken.wav
  Ahaha!

Series_Kill__VO_Lenna_Single_Kill_001.wav
  I'm sorry!

Series_Lose__VO_Lenna_Single_Lose_001.wav
  Uu... I'm sorry, Commander. But, as long as I'm with you, we'll be fine. Don't worry.

Series_Set_Fall__VO_Lenna_Series_Up_004.wav
  No, it's extremely effective!

Series_Set_Fall__VO_Lenna_Series_Up_006.wav
  I'll protect everyone!

Series_Skill01__VO_Lenna_Single_Skill_001.wav
  It's the white owl's voice!

Series_Skill02__VO_Lenna_Single_Skill_002.wav
  Found it!

Series_Tone_Negative_002.wav
  Eh!?

Series_Tone_Positive_003.wav
  Woohoo!

Series_Tone_Positive_006.wav
  Easy peasy!

Series_Tone_Positive_007.wav
  Oh, scary, scary!

Series_Tone_Positive_008.wav
  You're odd

  Disappear!

Series_Tone_Positive_010.wav
  Too bad.

Series_Ultimate__VO_Lenna_Single_Ultimate_SSR_001.wav
  Oke 많 sashimi , shirofukurou , eben dayou!

Series_Up_001.wav
  I wonder if I've gotten stronger?

Series_Up_005.wav
  Did something change?

Series_Up_007.wav
  Diva, will you praise me?

Series_Up_008.wav
  I've been of use to you, Libanee!

Series_Win__VO_Lenna_Single_Win_001.wav
  Perfect! I can't help but praise you, Riva-nee! Eheheh! Of course I want you to praise me too, Commander!

Single_Acquire_R_001.wav
  Huh? Another year has passed? Hmm... I didn't notice at all. Maybe it's because the Commander was by my side and I was too relaxed. Ehehe.

Single_Acquire_SR_001.wav
  It's already been a year, and the Commander is still a little kid. The time we spent as a family is not a year.

Single_Acquire_SSR_001.wav
  The day we started living together? Of course I remember! Hehe, that's right! What should I send to the commander? Shall I make a badge for him?

Single_Anniversary_001.wav
  Alright! I did my best for a year! I can rest for today! Ehehe, Commander, let's leave the trouble behind and enjoy the party together!

Single_Birthday_R_001.wav
  Happy birthday! Wait, what's wrong with that face? It's your family's birthday, so it's only natural to celebrate it!

Single_Birthday_SR_001.wav
  Commander? Yes! A present! Isn't it wonderful? I chose it with you! Happy birthday!

Single_Birthday_SSR_001_TypeA.wav
  Commander, happy birthday! Ehehe, I didn't expect you to think I'd come out! It's a surprise after all! Mission? Don't worry, I've finished it properly!

Single_Birthday_SSR_001_TypeB.wav
  Happy birthday! Eheheh! Eh? I won't forget it! Because you're my... Ufufu As I thought, it's a secret! Hurry up and open the present!

Single_Birthday_SSR_002.wav
  Today, there's a super, super, super fancy party at the Hermo-go, but who do you think will be the main character? Eheheh, that's right! We all prepared for you, Commander! I've also prepared a surprise for you, so look forward to it, Commander!

Single_Children_001.wav
  Ah, Commander! I'll give you this candy! It's really good! It looks cute after all! Ehehe! Hm? Do you want me to eat it? Sure! Come on, open your mouth! Aaaaah!

Single_Christmas_001.wav
  Alright, next I'll put this in here. Ah, Commander! This is the cracker I made. Pepli taught me. Do you want to make it together? If you make it together, it'll look more like a memorial day.

Single_Christmas_002.wav
  Merry Christmas! I've got presents for you, Commander. If you find something that suits your present, you'll have to buy it.

Single_Duanwu_001.wav
  Do you know that the Commander is a Dragon Boat? It looks like it's following the dragon, but there are dragons like that too. I thought that dragons all had big wings.

Single_Friendliness_001.wav
  Ehehe, as expected of the commander! Your footsteps haven't changed at all!

Single_Friendliness_002.wav
  Eh? I'm not the same as before? Hmm... Well, I've grown up, so I guess. Various things.

Single_Friendliness_003.wav
  Commander, you have to call me Rena here. Oh, right, I was told by Libra to give me this name. I like it.

Single_Friendliness_004.wav
  Ah, I was thinking about the Commander earlier. Fufu, it's natural to care about your family, right?

Single_Friendliness_005.wav
  Hehe, Commander, my geranium has finally bloomed! I won't let you get away this time!

Single_Friendliness_006.wav
  Hey, Commander, what are you doing? We're not that close yet, are we? Well, we're family, but... I-I can't let this go!

Single_Friendliness_007.wav
  Oh, Commander? It seems that you need nose care. Ahahahaha! How was it? Were you surprised? Ehehe, it's similar, right?

Single_Friendliness_008.wav
  Don't look at me like that. I changed my body, so there's no more wound. I guess I should carve it again. What do you think, Commander? I'm not sure if I should do that. I'm not sure if I should do that. I'm not sure if I should do that. I'm not sure if I should do that. I'm not sure if I should do that.

Single_Friendliness_009.wav
  Thank you for everything, Commander. This is a token of gratitude. Ahaha, you're serious? Commander's eyes are the same as before.

Single_Friendliness_010.wav
  Ah, Commander, look over there! Over there! Chup! Hehe, that wasn't a joke. What do you think? It wasn't as if you'd be surprised, right?

Single_Friendliness_011.wav
  Hehe, if you suddenly appear, the commander will be surprised. I'm looking forward to seeing your surprised face. But, when will the commander come out? Why are you suddenly coming out?

Single_Friendliness_012.wav
  Um, Commander, change is not a bad thing, right? Yeah, everyone's really gotten better. You too, and so is the Commander. I guess I have to work hard too!

Single_Friendliness_013.wav
  No, no. I'm sure the bank style will suit you, Commander. Why don't you give it a try? I know a good store. Let's go together!

Single_MidAutumn_001.wav
  Hehe, the moon that I see with my family looks even more beautiful. It's soft and bright, and I want to be like the moon.

Single_MidAutumn_002.wav
  Speaking of the Mid-Autumn Festival, it's the day when everyone in the family gathers. Today, I'm going to invite Riba, Karin, and everyone in 404 to watch the moon, so you must come too, Commander!

Single_NewYear_001.wav
  A wish... I'm happy enough now, but... Ah, it's spreading! I hope everyone and the commander can be together more!

Single_NewYear_002.wav
  Commander, have you decided how to spend New Year's? A visit? A holiday? Or shopping? Whatever you do is up to you, Commander. But you must be with your family!

Single_Obon_001.wav
  Commander, Commander! I'm going to dress up as a ghost tonight! Huh? Isn't that the day? I thought it was a day that wasn't very different from Halloween, but it wasn't.

Single_Obtain_R_001.wav
  Oh, so this is the rumored Elmo? That's great! I'll make it even more exciting!

Single_Obtain_SR_001.wav
  Ah, it's the Commander! I'm so glad! I'll protect you properly this time!

Single_Obtain_SSR_001.wav
  Ehehe, sorry to keep you waiting! Leave the rest to me!

Single_Passive_SSR_001.wav
  Good girl, good girl!

Single_SpringFes_001.wav
  Commander! Baa! Ehehe, are you surprised? I tried on a lion's costume. Isn't it cute? Today, I'll dance with Pepli, so please look forward to it!

Single_SpringFes_002.wav
  I've prepared a new costume for the commander. After I'm dressed, let's make a movie. The title is... The Spring of the Elm House. Everyone's gathered at the Elm House. I have to enjoy it with all my might.

Single_ThanksGiving_001.wav
  Um, you know, Commander, when I was looking for the seven-sided butterfly image earlier, I thought that it would look better after it was cooked. But I have to thank them.

  Here we go!

Single_Valentine_001.wav
  Commander, today is the day to tell them your feelings, right? Hehe, so I'm looking forward to it. You can't be so stupid anymore!

Single_Valentine_002.wav
  Since it's about the commander, I'm getting a lot of chocolates from everyone today. Hehe, so I devised a way to make a different chocolate from everyone's! What kind of devise is it? Look forward to opening it!

Single_WhiteVale_001.wav
  Eh? Another Valentine's Day? Isn't it too many to have two every year? Ah, but if I can be with you, it might not be too many.
