  Is that all?

Series_Cancel__VO_Macqiato_Series_Tone_Positive_003.wav
  Hey, you!

Series_Chosen__VO_Macqiato_Series_Up_008.wav
  Progress is necessary!

Series_Daily_001.wav
  Your base is like this. It's not bad... Of course, it's nothing compared to Zucchero.

Series_Daily_002.wav
  Hey, hey, you! Are you listening to me? Hey, what's wrong with you, bear? If you're feeling down, go rest!

Series_Daily_003.wav
  I made this with the recipe sent by Saint-Aurécie. If you don't mind... I-I didn't make it for you!

Series_Daily_004.wav
  Ah, you're so fluffy and you're crying like a cat. W-What are you looking at? I don't like cats. I just happened to be in your sight.

Series_Daily_005.wav
  Hey, you! Your whole body is covered in sand! If you're going out, at least wear protective clothing! What if you get hurt, you idiot! I-I'm not worried about you!

Series_Daily_006.wav
  So she's the rumored Vepri. Hmph, Sharklin can't even talk about people.

Series_Daily_007.wav
  My name? I just named it because I felt like it. Don't, don't make weird imaginations! It's not like I like caramel macchiato or anything, it's not that simple!

Series_Daily_008.wav
  B-by the way, why didn't you say anything at that time? If you don't want to answer, it's fine.

Series_Daily_009.wav
  I can't investigate you. Eh? Did you hear from Springfield? I-I just happened to see it when I was collecting information about the Yellow Area! T-That's why, don't misunderstand me!

Series_Daily_010.wav
  Recently, you're getting closer to other people. There's no deep meaning to it. Look, we're friends, aren't we? Springfield said that talking will shorten the distance.

Series_Die__VO_Macqiato_Series_Tone_Negative_002.wav
  It's not over yet!

Series_Hit__VO_Macqiato_Single_Hit_001.wav
  Disappear!

Series_Hitted.wav
  Hik!

Series_Kill__VO_Macqiato_Single_Kill_001.wav
  Easy win!

Series_Lose__VO_Macqiato_Single_Lose_001.wav
  A while ago, um... Um, I'm sorry.

Series_Set_Click__VO_Macqiato_Series_Tone_Positive_006.wav
  Leave it to me!

Series_Set_Fall__VO_Macqiato_Series_Tone_Positive_010.wav
  insignificant, isn't he?

Series_Skill01__VO_Macqiato_Single_Skill_001.wav
  I'll finish it!

Series_Skill02__VO_Macqiato_Single_Skill_002.wav
  Now!

Series_Tone_Negative_001.wav
  No way!

Series_Tone_Positive_002.wav
  You're in my way!

Series_Tone_Positive_004.wav
  Disappear!

Series_Tone_Positive_005.wav
  How annoying!

Series_Tone_Positive_007.wav
  Useless!

Series_Ultimate__VO_Macqiato_Single_Ultimate_SSR_001.wav
  I said I'm not letting you get away!

Series_Up_001.wav
  Hmm, what a good start.

Series_Up_002.wav
  This isn't enough!

Series_Up_003.wav
  It suits me perfectly!

Series_Up_004.wav
  Of course!

Series_Up_005.wav
  I have eyes to see!

Series_Up_006.wav
  Excellent!

Series_Up_007.wav
  I'll leave it to you next time.

Series_Win__VO_Macqiato_Single_Win_001.wav
  You should be grateful to me like you used to be.

Single_Acquire_SSR_001.wav
  Already a year? I can't believe I'm feeling this early. Could it be that I'm with you? No, no, no, that's not it. Ah, yeah. Anyway, I'll be in your care from now on. And I won't forgive you for leaving without saying anything.

Single_Anniversary_001.wav
  It's our first anniversary, so why not try something more special? It might be a boring line, but when it's hard, it'll pass. I'll always be with you.

Single_Birthday_SSR_001.wav
  Hey, today is a special day, so please be a little more happy. Why? Because today is your birthday! Anyway, happy birthday. I left the present at the desk, so don't forget it.

Single_Birthday_SSR_002.wav
  I think I've gained more experience in this year. It's my birthday once a year, so I'll praise you today. So don't get too excited.

Single_Children_001.wav
  W-What? Children's day has nothing to do with me! Even if I like sweets... It's not like that!

Single_Christmas_001.wav
  Dot Sight? But, even though it's a festival, it's not like I hate it when you put on a ribbon. I prepared it for you, so you can take it.

Single_Christmas_002.wav
  Christmas party? I'm not interested. Do you have one? Y-Yeah... I think about it a lot, and I'll go with you sometimes... Hey, don't laugh!

Single_Duanwu_001.wav
  Yes, Shanbao. Meirin said that you'll be a protection. You're always on a dangerous mission, so keep it. It's okay if you don't see it.

Single_Friendliness_001.wav
  Hey, you're too close. Move!

Single_Friendliness_002.wav
  If you have any trouble, just tell me. I-It depends on my mood if I can help you.

Single_Friendliness_003.wav
  You've been acting so tough lately? You should have done more requests. N-No! I'm not worried about you!

Single_Friendliness_004.wav
  You failed your mission? How many years have you been commanding a strategy? I can't believe you're taking information for granted. This time, take me with you.

Single_Friendliness_005.wav
  Commander, how is it? Do you miss me? You've been calling me like this since you were in Griffin. It's been 10 years since then.

Single_Friendliness_006.wav
  I'm not getting along with everyone? That's not true! Human relationships are just a pain in the ass!

Single_Friendliness_007.wav
  You need a huge endurance and absolute technique to shoot. Of course, I have both of them.

Single_Friendliness_008.wav
  You want to see my gun? I don't mind if you do, but... You have to handle it carefully!

Single_Friendliness_009.wav
  The yellow area at night is cold. You seem to be in a bad mood lately, but you're not cold, are you? Be sure to take precautions against the cold, idiot!

Single_Friendliness_010.wav
  To me, Zucchero is a very important place. I didn't know how to get along with people until now, and when I was in Griffin, I could only talk to you. What am I... Forget about that now!

Single_Friendliness_011.wav
  To tell you the truth, if you could just call me when you're away from Griffin... N-Nothing!

Single_Friendliness_012.wav
  If you can't stay in the Yellow Area, you can come to the Green Area and visit me. I have a house. It's not a large area, but it's enough for two people to live in. If I get a job and make money... I'm just asking if you can! If you can!

Single_Friendliness_013.wav
  Be more honest? How am I not being honest? In front of you, I can't... I can't...

Single_Login_001.wav
  Don't be so flustered! Hurry up and come!

Single_MidAutumn_001.wav
  The Mid-Autumn Festival is the day everyone gathers, right? Hmph, I don't need that. I can meet the person I want to meet every day... Wait, what are you grinning at? Look at the full moon! Don't look at me!

Single_MidAutumn_002.wav
  It seems that the Mid-Autumn Festival is a day of

Single_NewYear_001.wav
  Tonight, you don't have any plans anymore, right? Springfield and the others have prepared a new year's present for you, so let's open it together. What? I just don't want to waste Springfield's love. Don't misunderstand me.

Single_NewYear_002.wav
  After today's mission, why don't we go eat together? There's a restaurant in a town nearby that's running late... It's not like I'm trying to get old with you or anything!

Single_Obon_001.wav
  The day to find the person I love... I don't have such a person. If I have to say, I want the day to live without anyone finding me to continue forever.

Single_Obtain_SSR_001.wav
  ...! I did it, I found it! Hurry up and put it on the Hermo!

Single_Passive_SSR_001.wav
  Des fountain

Single_SpringFes_001.wav
  Meirin gave me a lot of fireworks... Umm, well... I can't use them all by myself! So, you know... Come to the roof right now with your protective clothing!

Single_SpringFes_002.wav
  It's a new year, so how about we take a few more days off? I-In fact, I got a pair show ticket for the luxury resort. It's a waste if it's just me, so I'll take you with me.

Single_ThanksGiving_001.wav
  Yeah, looks like I'm doing well today. The bear isn't bad, and my hair isn't messed up either. I'm wearing the right outfit for the festival. But my clothes are a little sweaty. Come here, I'll fix it for you. That's good enough. Also, there's an event for the Thanksgiving today, so don't forget.

Single_Title_001.wav
  Dolls Front Line 2 Exilium

Single_Valentine_001.wav
  What are you looking at? Do you think I'm going to prepare a present for you on a day like this? Hey, wait! I'm only going to say it once, so listen carefully! I... I like... I like the clothes you're wearing right now, don't I?

Single_Valentine_002.wav
  Huh? Chocolate? I wouldn't prepare something so ordinary! And... Eh? You didn't get it? The one behind me? Stop! Don't come any closer!

Single_WhiteVale_001.wav
  Hm? Why are you wearing clothes on a day like this? At times like this, you're probably making chocolate or candy yourself! On Valentine's Day, I praised your clothes, so I'm wearing the same clothes? Y-You... You're an idiot!
