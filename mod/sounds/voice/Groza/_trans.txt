  As something attracted to the какое as said earlier, I feel that those who have drawing skills would be satisfactory in Ainou's light. Commander, would you like some tea?ен

Series_Chosen_Auto__VO_Groza_Series_Tone_Positive_007.wav
  I think I can escape.

  Target confirmed.

  A new mission? Fine, leave it to me.

Series_Daily_002.wav
  Today's task is not over yet. Commander, do you need to confirm progress?

Series_Daily_003.wav
  ...That's... ...Carolick and... ...Remesis... ...Phew... At least, I want them to be quiet during the night.

Series_Daily_004.wav
  Commander, check the plan for this operation. No matter how easy the mission is, you must not lose your focus.

Series_Daily_005.wav
  Confident trust brings perfect victory.

  Commander, have you seen Meilin's collection? Hey, what are you hiding behind your back?

  Mission start, let's go. Don't worry, I'll return them all safely.

Series_Up_006.wav
  This feeling is...

Series_Up_007.wav
  Ready, Éric Oxford.

Series_Up_008.wav
  ...Oh? Aradama didn't seem nervous all along. But in Calm Down, they got mental and gave them all crap. Don't get the wrong idea. They just showed themselves to Guh Out artwork as master and saw themform their constitutions. I draw the shot with COLOR.

  It's been a year in a blink of an eye. Thanks to you, Commander, it's been a year full of joy. Let's continue to walk together, Commander.

Single_Acquire_SR_001.wav
  Commander, I have a lot to tell you over the past year. If I try to say it, I'll always be cut off by someone. But this feeling will not change. From now on, no matter what decision you make, I will believe in you. I swear I'll always be by your side.

Single_Acquire_SSR_001.wav
  Another year? Fufu, I'm grateful for your support throughout the year, Commander.

Single_Anniversary_001.wav
  Without your guidance, I wouldn't have been able to accomplish such a difficult mission. I can't measure your contribution. Hm? You're exaggerating? Then... Thank you for the past year, Commander.

Single_Birthday_R_001.wav
  Happy birthday. Today is a special day, so you have to relax. Leave all your work to me, Commander.

Single_Birthday_SR_001.wav
  Commander, happy birthday. Whatever you do today, you will be forgiven. Well then, first, have my special birthday dinner.

Single_Birthday_SSR_001.wav
  Birthday? I can't believe today is your birthday. It's been a while. How are you feeling? Me? Of course, I'm fine. Happy birthday, Commander.

Single_Birthday_SSR_002.wav
  I wanted to celebrate with you, so I opened up my schedule today. Hm? Today isn't your birthday, is it? But it's okay. I remember it. Happy birthday. I hope we can celebrate next year like this.

Single_Children_001.wav
  Work is important, but it's not bad to relax on a day like this. Oh, it seems that Helena has some candy left. Commander, would you like one?

Single_Christmas_001.wav
  Merry Christmas, Commander. Be careful, it's cold at night. I made two Santa hats. They're both made of cedar. One for Meilin, and the other for Commander. It's my responsibility as the captain to keep you healthy.

Single_Christmas_002.wav
  Merry Christmas, Commander. I brought a casimira coat to warm you up. I want you to always be in the best condition. As the captain, I won't let this go.

Single_Duanwu_001.wav
  Commander, this sashay is like a talisman, but it has a power like a talisman. Please accept it. Eh? The string of the talisman is really flashy. This is the tradition of the word theory, Commander. By doing this, you will avoid danger.

Single_Friendliness_001.wav
  Hm? ...It's not a nuisance. So, what do you order, Commander?

Single_Friendliness_002.wav
  Let me guess. That face. You had some trouble, didn't you? Eh? I did the same thing before?

Single_Friendliness_003.wav
  A new strategy report? I've already organized it. Do you want to check it now? That's right. So far, everything is fine. You can rest after the meeting, Commander.

Single_Friendliness_004.wav
  If you're going to work late at night, you should eat something high in calories. This cake is just... It's okay. This time, it's the recipe.

Single_Friendliness_005.wav
  This? I've made a new cooking cloth. I hope it will add more depth to the taste.

Single_Friendliness_006.wav
  Night is a precious time to be able to focus on yourself. Of course, it's not bad to spend time with the Commander.

  Commander, I've been studying how to make chocolate cakes lately, and they're pretty good. I guarantee you'll like them. Commander, try some.

Single_Friendliness_008.wav
  Have you ever eaten sushi? I've been thinking about trying it out lately, but Meirin says the fresh rice smells really good. I've already prepared the costumes you'll need to hold the sushi. Commander, look forward to it.

Single_Friendliness_009.wav
  The temperature last night was 4 degrees Celsius. From the Commander's point of view, it's a cold temperature. Commander, are you able to prevent the ship from being damaged? A new muffler has arrived. It's in the command room. Just in case, I'll call you to wear it when the temperature drops at night.

Single_Friendliness_010.wav
  Commander, you look tired. Would you like to lie down for a bit? Eh? You want me to stay by your side? Sure. I'll prepare some warm tea for you when you wake up.

  You're relying on me? Thank you, Commander. You're the best compliment I've ever received.

Single_Friendliness_012.wav
  I'm very honored to have your trust. I don't mind relying on you from now on, Commander.

Single_Friendliness_013.wav
  Me? You already knew what I wanted, right? Since I joined the team, you gave me everything I needed. Now I just wish for this peace to last forever.

Single_Login_001.wav
  Oh, you're in a hurry. Don't worry. I'll be kind enough to take care of you.

  I added a new tower to the mobile base. Commander, did you notice? I made it with everyone. How about tonight, Commander? Why don't you make a wonderful tower with us?

Single_MidAutumn_002.wav
  This year, I've revised the design of the lanterns to enhance its brightness and durability. If you like, how about a moon viewing with everyone? That's good. Everyone was expecting it.

Single_NewYear_001.wav
  Happy New Year, Commander. How about a Mechoo this year? Drinking it on a cold night will warm you up. Don't worry. I have 14 Mechoo that I reserved at the Bordeaux Nizza two weeks ago. I'll leave it in the command room. Meilin is happy too.

  I appreciate your support at the right time, Commander.

  The one on the window? I see, Commander. According to Meirin, if you paste the letters upside down, it will bring good luck for a year.

Single_SpringFes_002.wav
  I finished decorating the window. Meirin said it would be nice to draw a spring lotus, but what should I do? Yes, it's a new year. I want to know the commander's wish.
