[code]Commander, you&apos;re here. Good.



We&apos;ve been assigned operations in the contaminated zones. The areas are still unstable; Hostile forces have moved in, taken hostages, fortified positions. Someone needs to clear them out.



I know it&apos;s dangerous work, but... we&apos;ll be careful. Just give us the orders and we&apos;ll see it through.



What do you say, Commander?[/code]

[h3]Known Limitations[/h3]

Door Kickers 2 expects uniform model sizes, causing visual issues when importing GFL2 dolls with varying heights and builds. Tall, skinny dolls like Nemesis and short dolls like Colphne are particularly affected by these scaling requirements. I&apos;m working to minimise these issues while keeping dolls in their correct outfits.



Due to these limitations, models are optimised for the default top-down view rather than freelook mode. Any visual issues only visible in freelook will not be considered bugs.
