@WEAP-G11-NAME=G11
@WEAP-G11-DESC=During the Cold War, caseless ammunition was one of NATO's top projects, in order to achieve both easier ammunition storage/logistics and faster rate of fire. In the end, almost every project ended in failure or lost interest, with the exception of Heckler & Koch's G11. In theory, caseless munitions can achieve faster rates of weapon fire, since the process of the bolt unlocking followed by brass extraction and ejection is not needed with a bullet that doesn't come with a case; the weapon only needs to fire, load a new cartridge, and repeat.

Andoris is an expert intelligence officer due to her large storage space, and can pick up details anyone else would have missed.

@WEAP-G36K-NAME=G36K-KSK
@WEAP-G36K-DESC=The G36K (for kurz, “short”), is the shortened, carbine version of the G36 introduced by Heckler & Koch in 1997. Andoris uses a G36KA4, the variant used since 2022 by the Kommando Spezialkräfte (KSK), the special forces of the German Army.

@DOLL-G28-NAME=BELKA

But the fragile flower facade drops when she steps on the battlefield: even with her good performances, Belka never spares any effort. She aims to become an elite T-Doll like her Big Sis, and be useful to both her and the Commander. Her deepest desire is simply to remain by the side of the people she cherishes.
